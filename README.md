# community-network

In complex networks, a network is said to have community structure if the nodes of the network can be grouped into groups of nodes with dense connections internally, and sparser connections between groups.

In this project, we implemented an algorithm for detecting community structures (or clusters) in a network. The ability to detect such groups is of significant importance.
For example, partitioning a protein-protein interaction network into clusters can provide a modular view of the network, with different groups of nodes performing different functions within the cell.
